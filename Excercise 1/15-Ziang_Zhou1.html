  <em><strong>Middle-class Iranians,</strong></em> <em>&nbsp;like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. <br>
  Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. <br>
  In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and then Twitter. <br>
  Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is next. <br>
  But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. <br>
  Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly.<br>
  Maybe it’s that text itself is disappearing. After all, the first visitors to the web spent their time online reading web magazines. <br>
  Then came blogs, then Facebook, then Twitter. Now it’s Facebook videos and Instagram and SnapChat that most people spend their time on. <br>
  There’s less and less text to read on social networks, and more and more video to watch, more and more images to look at. <br>
  Are we witnessing a decline of reading on the web in favor of watching and listening?<br><br>
  Is this trend driven by people’s changing cultural habits, or is it that people are following the new laws of social networking? <br>
  I don’t know — that’s for researchers to find out — but it feels like it’s reviving old cultural wars. <br>
  After all, the web started out by imitating books and for many years, it was heavily dominated by text, by hypertext.<br>
  Search engines put huge value on these things, and entire companies — entire monopolies — were built off the back of them. <br>
  But as the number of image scanners and digital photos and video cameras grows exponentially, this seems to be changing. <br>
  Search tools are starting to add advanced image recognition algorithms; advertising money is flowing there.<br><br>
  But the Stream, mobile applications, and moving images: They all show a departure from a books-internet toward a television-internet. <br>
  We seem to have gone from a non-linear mode of communication — nodes and networks and links — toward a linear one, with centralization and hierarchies.<br>
  The web was not envisioned as a form of television when it was invented. But, like it or not, it is rapidly resembling TV: linear, passive, programmed and inward-looking.<br>
  When I log on to Facebook, my personal television starts. <br>
  All I need to do is to scroll: <br>New profile pictures by friends, <br>short bits of opinion on current affairs, <br>links to new stories with short captions, <br>advertising,<br> and of course self-playing videos. <br>
  I occasionally click on like or share button, read peoples’ comments or leave one, or open an article. <br>
  But I remain inside Facebook, and it continues to broadcast what I might like. This is not the web I knew when I went to jail. <br>
  This is not the future of the web. This future is television.<br><br>
  Sometimes I think maybe I’m becoming too strict as I age. Maybe this is all a natural evolution of a technology.<br>
  But I can’t close my eyes to what’s happening: <br>
  A loss of intellectual power and diversity, and on the great potentials it could have for our troubled time. <br>
  In the past, the web was powerful and serious enough to land me in jail. Today it feels like little more than entertainment. <br>
  So much that even Iran doesn’t take some — Instagram, for instance — serious enough to block.<br>
  I miss when people took time to be exposed to different opinions, and bothered to read more than a paragraph or 140 characters. <br>
  I miss the days when I could write something on my own blog, publish on my own domain, without taking an equal time to promote it on numerous social networks; when nobody cared about likes and reshares.<br>
  That’s the web I remember before jail. That’s the web we have to save.</em><br></p>
